## Adding new icon

Icons are managed in a special template in `src/template/index-icons.tsx`.
This package autogenerates two files: `index.tsx` and `metadata.ts`.
`index.tsx` is for production apps that don't require icon metadata.
`metadata.ts` is for development apps that need to access icon information such as name, keywords, or category.

In order to add your icon successfuly, you need to:

1. add your icon in src/template/index-icons.tsx
2. run `pnpm nx workspace-generator generateCode` from the package directory
3. add icon to the stories: `libs/components/icon/stories/Icons.stories.mdx`
4. commit
5. if you forget to generate code from the template, GitHub would do it for you by adding new commit in your PR

**Please don't edit main files directly** since they will be overwritten next time someone changes something in the template.
